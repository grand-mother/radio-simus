## Description
THE PHILOSOPHY

<!-- Add here a description of the package -->


## How to contribute to the code development

* If you are new to github, please, create a user account and send your username to Olivier or Valentin#1 to get added to the grand-mother poeple.
    - a useful start is to checkout provided Git Cheat Sheets, e.g. [link to one short git guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-git-a-reference-guide) or [link to a sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)

* clone this repository: '''git clone https://github.com/grand-mother/radio-simus.git'''
* Implement your ideas/changes etc. Be aware that those ones are not in conflict with other user's needs. Therefore run the tests: '''python3 -m tests'''
* Write up a documentation to your implemented function etc. (tool to be identified, worst case: docstring in code). Implement tests to prevent other user to break your needed functionality.
* Commit with messages and push: '''git commit -m '<what was done>' <file>; git push'''
    NOTE: This will be change to a pull request soon-ish.
* Validate that travis build tests pass after commitment
