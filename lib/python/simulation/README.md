# ToDos

* identify original antenna ID in simulations
** in CoREAS: store additional files (.info) containing infos like ID and antenna position as well as specification on the simulation itself for later reprodution
-> read-in implemented in simtohdf5
** ZHAireS: the new version now stores that the information of the antenna ID and position in the produced antpos.dat file of the event
-> read-in to be produced

* define clearly the used units of the input parameters
-> internally stick to : eV, deg, m, ns
